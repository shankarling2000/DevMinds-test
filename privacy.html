        <h2>CAN SPAM Act</h2>
        <p>
            The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.
        </p>
        <p>

        </ul>
        <p>
            To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.</li>
